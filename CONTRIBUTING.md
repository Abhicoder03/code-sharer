  # Introduction

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This repository is free + open-
source and as such dependent on your contributions. These guidelines should help
you get started more quickly and should ensure a smooth contribution process for
both those contributing and those reviewing contributions. Please read them
thoroughly before contributing with a Pull Request, and at least skim them before adding an issue.

We are open to all kinds of contributions as long as you follow our
[Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct/). For very specific use case it might make more sense
though to create your own repository instead of adding to this one.

# How to ask for help

At the moment, it is totally fine to open an issue if you have any questions.
This might change though depending on the time needed to answer. Although,
please note that this is free and open source software and there is no
guarantees on any kind of support from our side.

# How to request a feature

Please use the corresponding issue template to submit your idea on GitHub. Given
that this repo is a free open source project, chances of your idea
coming into fruition are much higher if you are also willing to contribute a PR.
Please first open the issue, though, so we can discuss the feature before you
have to spend time on it.

# How to create a PR

First please [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
to be able to contribute any changes.

The code in this codebase is managed by [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version
control, and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) for running scripts.

We recommend to read up on tools you are unfamiliar with.

After all tools are installed, please run `npm install` to install all
dependencies and then `npm test` to ensure that everything is set up correctly.

Now you can create a new branch describing the change you are about to make,
e. g. `fix_typo_in_documentation`, and start coding.

## Your First Contribution

If you are interested in contributing, but don't have a specific issue at heart,
we would recommend looking through the issues labelled "help wanted".

If you are new to contributing to open source, we recommend to have a look at
a [free tutorial](http://makeapullrequest.com/) for this. Issues labelled "good first issue"
are meant specifically to get started in the repository.

If you are stuck at any point, feel free to comment in the issue you chose. We
try to be as helpful to newcomers as possible and you don't have to be afraid of
bad questions. There are no bad questions!
